# CharaChorder Practice Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a practice environment for CharaChorder users to improve their typing efficiency and learn chord combinations, starting with mastering individual character positions through an adaptive learning system.

## About CharaChorder
- Revolutionary typing device that enables chord-based typing
- Allows typing entire words/phrases with simultaneous keypresses
- Can dramatically increase typing speeds (potential for 250+ WPM)
- Available models:
  - CharaChorder Lite (keyboard-like design)
  - CharaChorder One (pillar-based design)

## Current Implementation Status

### âœ… Completed Features

1. Sequential Practice Mode
   - Fixed sequence of characters based on frequency
   - Visual feedback for correct/incorrect inputs
   - Consecutive success tracking
   - Progress indicators and statistics
   - Reset functionality

2. Dynamic Practice Mode
   - Adaptive difficulty system
   - Starts with highest frequency letters (E, A, R, I, O)
   - Performance-based progression every 10 attempts
   - New letter mastery system (5 successful attempts required)
   - Dynamic review system:
     - Detects struggling letters (3+ mistakes in last 5 attempts)
     - Requires 5 successful attempts to exit review mode
     - Prioritizes review letters in practice sequence
     - Visual indicators for letters under review
   - Visual progress indicators:
     - Progress dots for new letters
     - Success/failure feedback
     - Current character display
     - Active letters overview
     - Next letters preview
   - Local storage for progress persistence
   - Reset functionality
