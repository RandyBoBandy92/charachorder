# CharaChorder Practice Project

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a practice environment for CharaChorder users to improve their typing efficiency and learn chord combinations, starting with mastering individual character positions through an adaptive learning system.

## About CharaChorder
- Revolutionary typing device that enables chord-based typing
- Allows typing entire words/phrases with simultaneous keypresses
- Can dramatically increase typing speeds (potential for 250+ WPM)
- Available models:
  - CharaChorder Lite (keyboard-like design)
  - CharaChorder One (pillar-based design)

## Learning Strategy

### Phase 1: Adaptive Letter Mastery
1. Dynamic Letter Introduction
   - Start with highest frequency letters: E (11.16%), A (8.50%), R (7.58%), I (7.54%), O (7.16%)
   - Introduce new letters based on performance metrics
   - Adapt to user's learning pace
   - Remove problematic letters temporarily for focused practice

2. Performance-Based Progression
   - Monitor rolling window of recent attempts (last 20)
   - Evaluate accuracy and consistency
   - Advance difficulty based on demonstrated mastery
   - Provide targeted practice for struggling letters

3. Feedback Mechanisms
   - Real-time performance tracking
   - Visual mastery indicators
   - Progress dashboards
   - Error pattern analysis
   - Response time monitoring

4. Learning Reinforcement
   - Adaptive difficulty maintains engagement
   - Immediate feedback builds correct muscle memory
   - Multiple practice modes for varied learning
   - Data-driven practice recommendations

### Practice Modes
1. Adaptive Mode (Primary)
   - Dynamic difficulty adjustment
   - Performance-based letter introduction
   - Automatic focus on problem areas

2. Fixed Mode
   - Practice current mastered set
   - Build consistency and speed
   - Reinforce learned patterns

3. Challenge Mode
   - Preview upcoming letters
   - Push comfort zone safely
   - Prepare for next difficulty level

## Technical Implementation
Current version focuses on:
- React + TypeScript for robust type safety
- Clean, modern UI with clear feedback
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
- Performance optimization for typing input
- Immediate visual feedback system
- Local storage for progress tracking
- Performance analytics

## Research Basis
1. Spaced Repetition
   - Gradually increasing intervals between reviews
   - Focus on problematic characters
   - Maintain practice of mastered characters

2. Adaptive Learning
   - Adjust difficulty based on performance
   - Personalized learning pace
   - Data-driven progression

3. Motor Learning Theory
   - Build muscle memory through consistent practice
   - Immediate feedback for proper reinforcement
   - Progressive difficulty for skill development
