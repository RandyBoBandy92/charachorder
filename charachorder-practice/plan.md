# CharaChorder Character Practice - Development Plan

## Version 1.0 - Sequential Character Practice (Current Implementation)

### Core Functionality
1. Sequential character mastery mode
   - Start with 'E' and require 5 consecutive correct hits
   - Advance to next character only after mastering current
   - Any mistake resets to beginning ('E')
   - Track best streak through the sequence
   - Show last key pressed for immediate feedback

### Data Structure
```typescript
// Frequency-ordered characters (top 10)
const FREQUENT_CHARS = [
  { char: "E", frequency: 11.1607 },
  { char: "A", frequency: 8.4966 },
  { char: "R", frequency: 7.5809 },
  { char: "I", frequency: 7.5448 },
  { char: "O", frequency: 7.1635 },
  { char: "T", frequency: 6.9509 },
  { char: "N", frequency: 6.6544 },
  { char: "S", frequency: 5.7351 },
  { char: "L", frequency: 5.4893 },
  { char: "C", frequency: 4.5388 }
];
```

### User Interface Components
1. Character Display
   - Large, centered current character
   - Visual feedback for incorrect attempts
   - Shake animation on mistakes

2. Input Feedback
   - Last key pressed display
   - Color-coded feedback (green for correct, red for incorrect)
   - Clear visual distinction between target and input

3. Progress Indicators
   - Best streak counter
   - Consecutive hits counter
   - Visual sequence display showing:
     - Completed characters (green)
     - Current character (blue)
     - Upcoming characters (gray)

4. Statistics
   - Overall accuracy percentage
   - Clear instructions

### Visual Design

   - Time between keystrokes
   - Common mistake patterns
   - Session history

2. Progress Visualization
   - Heat map of accuracy by character
   - Progress over time charts
   - Personal best tracking

### Learning Aids

## Version 1.5 - Dynamic Difficulty System

### Core Functionality
1. Dynamic Letter Set Management
   ```typescript
   interface LetterProgress {
     char: string;
     frequency: number;
     accuracy: number;
     attempts: number;
     lastAttempts: boolean[];  // Rolling window of recent attempts
     mastered: boolean;
     dateIntroduced: Date;
   }

   interface PracticeState extends CurrentState {
     activeLetters: LetterProgress[];
     masteredLetters: LetterProgress[];
     nextLettersToAdd: LetterProgress[];
   }
   ```

2. Progression Algorithm
   - Initial Set: E, A, R, I, O (highest frequency letters)
   - Advancement Criteria (checked every 20 attempts):
     * 90% accuracy overall
     * Last 10 attempts performance:
       - No mistakes → Add 2 new letters
       - 1-2 mistakes → Add 1 new letter
       - >2 mistakes → Maintain current set
   - Letter Addition Order: Based on frequency ranking
   - Regression Mechanism: Can temporarily remove struggling letters

3. Practice Modes
   a. Adaptive Mode (Primary)
      - Dynamic letter set adjustment
      - Real-time difficulty scaling
      - Performance-based letter introduction
   
   b. Fixed Mode
      - Practice current mastered letter set
      - No automatic adjustments
      - Good for reinforcement
   
   c. Challenge Mode
      - Includes mastered letters + 1 new letter
      - Preview upcoming letters
      - Build familiarity with future letters

### User Interface Enhancements
1. Progress Dashboard
   - Active letter set display
   - Individual letter statistics
   - Recent performance graph
   - Next potential letters preview

2. Visual Feedback
   - Current letter set visualization
   - Mastery indicators per letter
   - Performance trends
   - Last key pressed feedback
   - Success/failure indicators

3. Practice Session Controls
   - Mode selection
   - Difficulty adjustment
   - Letter set customization
   - Session duration settings

### Data Management
1. Progress Tracking
   ```typescript
   interface LetterStatistics {
     totalAttempts: number;
     correctAttempts: number;
     averageResponseTime: number;
     mistakePattern: Record<string, number>;  // What letters are mistaken for
     masteryDate?: Date;
   }
   ```

2. Performance Metrics
